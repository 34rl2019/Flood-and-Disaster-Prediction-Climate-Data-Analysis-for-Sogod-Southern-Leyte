Flood and Disaster Prediction

Flood and Disaster Prediction (Climate Data Analysis) for Sogod, Southern Leyte

 Problem Description
Sogod, a municipality in Southern Leyte, is frequently affected by flooding due to its geographical features, including the Subang Daku River and nearby mountainous areas. Heavy rainfall, especially during the typhoon season, causes the river to overflow and leads to water runoff from the mountains, resulting in widespread flooding in both urban and rural barangays. These floods significantly impact infrastructure, agriculture, and homes, disrupting the lives of residents. 
The absence of a reliable early warning system worsens the situation, leaving communities unprepared for sudden rises in water levels. To address this issue, this project proposes the development of a Flood and Disaster Prediction System using climate data analysis to forecast floods and provide early warnings. The system will leverage historical and realtime data to enhance disaster preparedness, enabling local authorities and residents of Sogod to take necessary precautions and reduce the risks associated with flooding.

 Project Scope
The Flood and Disaster Prediction System will use climate data analysis to forecast potential flood events in Sogod, Southern Leyte. The system will analyze historical climate data (e.g., rainfall, temperature, river levels) alongside geographical and environmental factors to predict flood risk. By integrating efficient data structures and algorithms, the system will provide realtime predictions and alerts, helping residents and authorities respond effectively to potential floods.

 1. Problem Identification
Flooding in Sogod, Southern Leyte is a persistent issue due to the municipality's proximity to the Subang Daku River and its lowlying areas. Frequent heavy rains and inadequate drainage systems contribute to regular flooding, damaging properties, crops, and local infrastructure. The need for a flood prediction system is critical, as the lack of early warnings results in uncoordinated responses and heightened risks to life and property.

The key challenges are:
•	Data management: Collecting and organizing large amounts of climate data from various sources.
•	Accurate flood prediction: Utilizing algorithms capable of processing historical and real-time data to make predictions.
•	Timely alerts: Ensuring the system can send alerts in time for preventive actions to be taken.

 2. Data Structure Selection & Design
To effectively predict floods and manage the complexity of data, appropriate data structures are selected:
1. Time Series Data (Arrays/Lists)
    Purpose: Store chronological data such as daily rainfall and river levels, enabling time-based trend analysis.
    Why: Timeseries data structures facilitate the quick retrieval of past records, which are crucial for flood pattern analysis.
2. Graphs (Geographical Representation)
    Purpose: Represent geographical areas and their interconnections (e.g., proximity to rivers, drainage paths). Each node represents a barangay, and edges represent relationships like river flow or flood spread potential.
    Why: Graphs allow us to model how floods propagate across different barangays and regions.


3. Binary Search Tree (Threshold Conditions)
    Purpose: Store threshold values for critical factors such as river levels and rainfall intensity. 
    Why: Using a BST enables fast comparison of realtime data with preset flood warning levels.
4. Hash Maps (RealTime Data Retrieval)
    Purpose: Efficiently store and retrieve realtime sensor data from different barangays, such as rainfall and river levels.
    Why: Hash maps offer constanttime access to realtime data, ensuring the system can react swiftly to changing conditions.

 3. Implementation
The system is implemented in several phases:
1. Data Collection:
    Climate data (rainfall, temperature, river levels) is collected from local weather stations and sensors. Time series data structures are used for organizing and storing this information.
    A graph is constructed to represent the geography of Sogod, with nodes representing barangays and edges modeling water flow and flood risk pathways.
2. Threshold Monitoring:
    A binary search tree stores critical thresholds for river levels and rainfall. As new realtime data comes in, the system checks if these thresholds are exceeded.

3. Flood Propagation Simulation:
    The system uses a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., BreadthFirst Search) to simulate flood propagation from one barangay to neighboring areas based on rising water levels.
4. Alert Mechanism:
    Once a flood risk is detected, the system automatically generates alerts for the affected areas, giving residents and officials time to respond.
 4. Optimization
Optimizations ensure the system operates efficiently despite the large dataset:
1. Efficient Storage: Climate data is compressed, and only relevant data is kept in active memory, while older data is archived.
2. Incremental Data Updates: Rather than recalculating the entire flood model, only the affected parts of the graph are updated as new data is received.
3. Parallel Processing: Multiple cores are used to run predictions in parallel for different barangays, speeding up the prediction process.
4. Caching: Frequently accessed data is cached to avoid redundant database queries and reduce system latency.
 5. Analysis & Benchmarking

The system’s performance is evaluated based on:
1. Time Complexity:
    Graph traversal: The flood prediction algorithm (BreadthFirst Search) runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of barangays and E is the number of connections between them.
    Threshold monitoring: The BST enables O(log N) performance for threshold comparison operations.

2. Space Complexity:
    Climate data storage requires O(n) space, where n is the number of daily records. The graph representing barangays and flood paths has a space complexity of O(V + E).

3. Accuracy: The predictions are compared with actual historical flood data to finetune the model for accuracy.
4. Response Time: Realtime data updates and flood alerts are generated within a few seconds of detecting critical thresholds.

 6. Visualization
The system includes visualization tools to help users understand flood predictions:
1. Geographical Map:
    A live map displaying barangays at risk of flooding, with color-coding based on flood risk levels.
2. Real-Time Dashboard:
    A dashboard displaying real-time climate data such as rainfall and river levels, with graphical representations of trends and thresholds.
3. Alert System:
    Popup alerts on the map show affected areas, allowing residents and officials to act. 
4. Simulation Mode:
    A feature for running hypothetical flood scenarios by adjusting climate factors (e.g., rainfall levels) to assess how different conditions would affect flood risk.

 Conclusion

This Flood and Disaster Prediction System for Sogod, Southern Leyte, effectively combines climate data analysis, data structures, and algorithms to predict and respond to flood risks. By integrating realtime data, geographical models, and an alert system, the project aims to enhance disaster preparedness and reduce the devastating impact of floods on local communities.
